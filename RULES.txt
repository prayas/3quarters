# RULES
Arrange one (add, rotate or remove) quadrant at a time to complete a 3/4 circle. 
In a turn each player gets to arrange (add, rotate or remove) one piece. You can turn as many corners as the dice  (d4) shows. If the dice show 4, you have to turn full circle.
To remove a quadrant, place a quadrant with the same pattern on it. Take both (without adding the points that both pieces have). A player can remove a piece only three times in a game. 
The player who completes the 3/4 circle removes the pieces from the board and takes as many points as the constituent pieces. 
If a 3/4 circle has one of its quadrants on a yellow square, the score is doubled. 
The player with 25 points first wins. 
Avoid emptying the board â€” it will give you a penalty of 10 points.
